Why bother?
  - To make things easy for library users, distribution packagers and
    developers of library bindings for other programming languages.

use autotools
  - every custom config/makefile build system is worse for everybody
    than autotools is
  - we are all used to autotools, it works, nobody cares
  - it's only two simple files to edit and include in git, which are
    well understood by many many people, not just you.
  - ignore all crap autotools create in the source tree. never check
    the created files into git
  - Never, ever, ever install config.h. That's internal to your
    sources and is nothing to install.
  - And really, anything but autotools is not an option. Just get over
    it. Everything else is crack, and it will come back to you if you
    choose anything else, sooner or later. Why? think cross
    compilation, installation/uninstallation, build root integration,
    separate object trees, standard adherence, tarball handling, make
    distcheck, portability between distros, ...

If you use the GPL, always use the GPL's "(or later)" clause
  - developers are not lawyers, libraries should be able to be linked
    to any version of the GPL. Remember that GPL2-only is incompatible
    with LGPL3!

use LGPL if you don't care about politics
  - low-level library interfaces are conceptually similar to kernel
    syscall ior proc/sysfs interfaces, which also don't have
    restrictions.

zero global state -- Make your library threads-aware, but *not*
thread-safe!
  - an app can use liba and libb. libb internally can also use liba --
    without you knowing. Both you and libb can run liba code at the
    very same time in different threads and operate at the same global
    variables, without telling you about that. Loadable modules make
    this problem even more prominent, since the libraries they pull in
    are generally completely unknown by the main application. And
    *every* program has loadable modules, think NSS!
  - avoid locking and mutexes, they are very unlikely to work correctly,
    and incredibly hard to get right.
  - always use a library context object. every thread should then
    operate on its own context. Do not imply context objects via TLS. It
    won't work. TLS inheritance to new threads will get in your way. TLS
    is a problem in itself, not a solution.
  - do not use gcc constructors, or destructors, you can only loose if
    you do. Do not use _fini() or _ini(), don't even use your own
    explicit library initializer/destructor functions. It just won't
    work if your library is pulled in indirectly from another library
    or even a shared module (i.e. dlopen())
  - Always use O_CLOEXEC, SOCK_CLOEXEC and friends. It's not an
    option, it's a must.
  - Don't use global variables (it includes static variables defined
    inside functions). Ever. And under no circumstances export global
    variables. It's madness.

use a common prefix for _all_ exported symbols
  - Avoids namespace clashes
  - Also, hacking is not a contest of finding the shortest possible
    function name. And nobody cares about your 80ch line limit!
  - If you use a drop-in library in your own library make sure to hide its
    symbols with symbol versioning. Don't forget to hide *all* symbols, and
    don't install the header file of the used drop-in library.

do not expose any complex structures in your API
  - use get() and set() instead
  - all objects should be opaque
  - exporting structs in headers is OK in very few cases only: usually
    those where you define standard binary formats (think: file
    formats, datagram headers, ...) or where you define well-known
    primitive types (think struct timeval, struct iovec, uuid
    type).
  - Why bother? Because struct stat, struct dirent and friends are
    disasters. Particularly horrible are structs with fixed-size
    strings.

Use the de-facto standardized function names. It's abc_new(),
abc_free(), abc_ref(), abc_unref(), and nothing else. Don't invent
your own names, and don't use the confusing kernel-style ref counting
function names: _get() is for accessing properties of objects, nothing
else.

Stick to kernel coding style. Just because you are otherwise not bound
by the kernel guidelines when your write userspace libraries doesn't
mean you have to give up the good things it defines.

avoid callbacks in your API
  - language bindings want iterators
  - programmers want iterators too

never call exit(), abort(), be very careful with assert()
  - always return error codes
  - libraries need to be safe for usage in critical processes that
    need to recover from errors instead of getting killed (think PID 1!)

Avoid thinking about main loops/event dispatchers.
  - Get your stuff right in the kernel: fds are awesome, expose them
    in userspace and in the library, because people can easily integrate
    them with their own poll() loops of whatever kind they have.
  - Don't hide file descriptors away in your headers.
  - Never add blocking kernel syscalls, and never add blocking library
    calls either (with very few exceptions). Userspace code is primarily
    asynchronous around event loops, and blocking calls are generally
    incompatible with that.
  - Corollary of that: always O_NONBLOCK!

functions should return int and negative errors instead of NULL
  - return NULL in malloc() is fine, return NULL in fopen() is not!
  - pass allocated objects as parameter (yes, ctx_t** is OK!)
  - returning kernel style negative <errno.h> error codes is cool in
    userspace too. Do it!

provide pkgconfig files
  - apps want to add a single line to their configure file,
    they do not want to fiddle with the parameters, dependencies
    to setup and link your library
  - it's just how we do these things today on Linux, and everything
    else is just horribly messy.

avoid hidden fork()/exec() in libraries
  - apps generally do not expect signals and react allergic to them
  - mutexes, locks, threads of the app might get confused. Mixing
    mutexes and fork() equals failure. It just can't work, and
    pthread_atfork() is not a solution for that, because it's broken
    (even POSIX acknowledges that, just read the POSIX man
    pages!). fork() safety for mutex-ridden code is not an
    afterthought, it's a broken right from the beginning.

Make your code safe for unexpected termination and any point:
  - Do not leave files dirty or temporary files around
  - This is a tricky, since you need to design your stuff like this
    from the beginning, it's not an afterthought, since you generally
    do not have a place to clean up your stuff on exit. gcc
    destructors are NOT the answer.

use symbol versioning
  - only with that, RPM can handle dependencies for added symbols
  - Hide all internal symbols! *This is important!*

always provide logging/debugging, but do not clutter stderr
  - allow the app to hook the libs logging into its logging facility
  - use conditional logging, do not filter too late
  - do not burn cycles with printf() to /dev/null
  - by default: do not generate any output on stdout/stderr

always use 'make distcheck' to create tarballs
  - never release anything that does not pass distcheck. it will
    likely be broken for others too

use ./autogen.sh to bootstrap the git repo
  - always test bootstrapping with 'git clean -x -f -d' before release

avoid any spec files or debian/ subdirs in git trees
  - distribution specific things do not belong in upstream trees,
    but into distro packages

update NEWS to let developers know what has changed
  - history of the project from version to version, not a commit changelog
  - add commit changelog from git, do not maintain your own

use standard types
  - The kernel's u8, u16, ... correspond to uint8_t, uint16_t in
    userspace from <inttypes.h>. Nothing else. Don't define your own
    typedefs for that, don't include the kernel types in common
    headers.
  - Use enums, not #define for constants, wherever possible. In
    userspace you have debuggers, and they are much nicer to use if
    you have proper enum identifiers instead of macro definitions,
    because the debugger can translate binary values back to enum
    identifiers, but not macros. However, be careful with enums in
    function prototypes: they might change the int type they are
    resolved to as you add new enum values.

always guard for multiple inclusions of headers
  - You must place #ifndef libabc, #define libabc, #endif in your
    header files. There is no other way.

Be careful with variadic functions
  - it's cool if you provide them, but you must accompany them with
    "v" variants (i.e. functions taking a va_arg object), and provide
    non-variadic variants as well. This is important to get language
    wrappers right.

Don't put "extern" in front of your function prototypes in headers
  - It has no effect, no effect at all. Just don't do it.

Never use sysv IPC, always use POSIX IPC
  - shmops and semops are horrors. Don't use them. Ever. POSIX IPC is
    much much much nicer.

Do not multiplex functions via ioctl()/prctl() style variadic functions
  - Type-safety is awesome!

executing out-of-process tools and parsing their output is not
acceptable in libraries. Ever.
  - tools should be built on top of their own lib
  - separate 'mechanism' from 'policy'

Function calls with 15 arguments are a bad idea. If you have tons of
booleans in a function call, then replace them by a flag argument!
  - Think about the invocation! foo(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1) is stupid!
    foo(FOO_QUUX|FOO_BAR|FOO_WALDO) much nicer.

Don't be afraid of C99. Use it.
  - It's 12 years old. And it's nice.

Never expose fixed size strings in your API
  - Pass malloc()ed strings out, or ask the caller to provide you with
    a buffer, and return ENOSPC if too short.

glibc has byteswapping calls, don't invent your own:
  - le32toh(), htole32() and friends
  - bswap32() and friends()

don't typedef pointers to structs!

Don't write your own LISP interpreter and do not include it in your
library.
